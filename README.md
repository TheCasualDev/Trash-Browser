# ðŸ—‘ Trash Browser
I got really bored one night and thought "Hey I wonder how you make a web browser" and this was the amazing output!

This was created by following a single [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-5bZ8EoKu4) by [Programming Hero](https://www.youtube.com/c/ProgrammingHero), and though it was a intresting experince I think next time I try to make a browser I'll just work off of Chromium :)
