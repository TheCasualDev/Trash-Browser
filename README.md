# üóë Trash Browser
I got really bored one night and thought "Hey I wonder how you make a web browser" and this was the amazing output!
<br>
This was created by following a single [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-5bZ8EoKu4) by [Programming Hero](https://www.youtube.com/c/ProgrammingHero), and though it was a intresting experince I think next time I try to make a browser I'll just work off of Chromium :)

# ‚úè Setup
Obviously this dosen't have a simple `exe` that you can download and run. So there are a few steps to set this bad boy up. If you for some reason wish to use it.
<br>
The first step is getting the correct python build, now due to the libraries used in this project the only one that has worked for me is **Python 3.9.13** 
<br> 
Next step is getting the correct libraries installed, for this project I used **PyQt5**, **PyQtWebEngine** & **Curses**. To install these simple open a command prompt and install the following. 
<br>
<br>
```pip install PyQtWebEngine``` <br> 
```pip install PyQt5``` <br> 
```pip install windows-curses``` -- Supposedly this libary should auto install, but it didn't for me.
